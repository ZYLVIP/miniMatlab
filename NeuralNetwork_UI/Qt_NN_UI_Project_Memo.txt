  1. 
  This project is for creating neural network (NN) user interface (UI).
  The graphical interface uses Qt.

  2. 
  This project begins with the "plotter" exercise which draws several
  curves by reading data from a file.

  3. 
  I put the past GTK plotter code into this project for merging.

  4.
  I wish this project will evolve into a Neural Network Designer
  (NNDesigner).

  5.
